## Simon's Supurb Stock Market Sceme to Sublet $$$


## Description
This project has a buy stocks within a list (named "not") on the logged in account. The bot buys only stocks that have over 50% reccomendation of buy and less than 30% sell. They also filter for if you already own the stock, if you can afford the stock, if the stock is priced between $1-5 and if buying the stock would be a day trade. After buying the stocks, it sells stocks on the signed in account overall. The bot only sells stocks that have reccomendations of less than 90% buy, stocks that are not day trades and will only place limit orders of 20 cents more than the bought price. This process will repeat until the program is stopped or crashed.
